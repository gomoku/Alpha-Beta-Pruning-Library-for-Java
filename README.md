Alpha-Beta Pruning Library for Java. Since a long time I have been creating games with AI computer opponents, e.g. Chess, Tic-tac-toe and Gomoku. Each time I used the Alpha-beta pruning algorithm and each time I coded the algorithm anew to match the gamesâ specific features. In fact, it is possible to save a lot of coding time by using the same class for a broad variety of board games. Thatâs why I created an open source library for the Alpha-beta pruning algorithm.
